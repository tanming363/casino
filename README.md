# River Tech FE Interview

## Instructions

### Requirements

Create a mini casino website which contains;

- Home page \* Containing a list of all `trending` games
- Expandable Side menu \* Links to `home` and `games`
- Games page
  _ List of all games
  _ Search
  _ When the user types inside the search field the games list should update in real time with the results
  _ There should be a 500ms delay between the user typing and updating of results \* The URL should contain the `search term` as a query param
  - Drop down filter by provider
    _ Only one provider at a time can be selected
    _ Include an option to `Show all providers`
    _ ***not done**Clicking an already selected provider deselects it
    _ When selecting/deselecting a provider from the list it should be reflected inside the url \* (Advanced) Provider list should be updated depending on the searched results only
  - Search and providers filtering should work in conjunction e.g. `http://localhost:4200/games?searchTerm=book&provider=Kalamba%20Games`
    -***not done**Clearing the search should not clear the game provider filter and vice versa
- Game page
  _ Contains the thumb and a `Play for Fun` button which redirects to the game by using the `startUrl`
  _ Use the `Game.slug` for the `URL` param
- (Advanced) Last Played Games
  _ At the bottom for all pages, have a section called `Last Played`
  _ Game is considered as `Last Played` when the user has navigated to the Game Page
  _ Only Show the 5 most recent games
  _ Should not contain duplicate games
  _ Should be ordered by last played first
  _ Should be persisted even after the user refreshes the browser
- Linting
  - Project should pass all lint rules

### Technical Details

- The solution should be built using Angular, SCSS and TypeScript.
- Use Redux; The scaffolding provided already has `ngxs` installed, you may use other libraries if you want.
- Use the data provided inside the scaffolding `game.mock-data.json` (There should be no alterations to the data provided)
- You may use any libraries or plug-ins you wish to fulfill the requirements.

### Rating

- You may create the solution however you want, these are key things we will look for;
  - All requirements are met (non-advanced)
  - Best practices
  - Code structure, readability and reusability
  - Error handling
  - Performance considerations
  - RxJS operators usage
  - Redux State
  - Modelling data with TypeScript
  - Polished Design
  - SCSS usage

## Development

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Lint

Run `npm run lint` to lint the project. This will lint both `ts` and `scss` files.
